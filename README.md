# What does this code do?
The price data that usually comes from exchange markets are the nutrients for time series analysis in data science. We needed the requests, demands, and price data of the Iran energy market to consider the possibility of fitting a machine learning model on them. To get these data from the electricity market, we developed this code that could be generalized easily to crawl other symbols from tsetmc.com. Thus, this repository contains a crawler for getting data from Iran's electricity energy exchange market [https://tsetmc.com](https://tsetmc.com).
